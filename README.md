# Textildesign

This is a website for my mother, she is a textile and colour designer.
The website should introduce her as a person and offer a contact option. Next I want to create the portfolio page with her best work. Later I would like to integrate a blog (tips & tricks) and a little shop.

## The problem

I have tried to integrate in this website everything that I have learned in the course. I had the biggest difficulties with the hamburger menu. But with a lot of trial and error and the help of the other students, I managed to do it. I also had a few problems with the message field in the contact menu until it looked the way I wanted it to.
