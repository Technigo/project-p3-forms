# Project Name

I created a form to submit a recipe, inspired by my previous project (flexbox - responsive dessert recipe website).

## The problem

I used different types of input types according to what was asked to specify by the user. I came across a few small issues:
- Temperature: I used a "text" type instead of a number because the number field appeared too long and I could not shorten it or style it with a size.
- For the ingredients I would have loved to create a cloud of possible ingredients to select (checkbox) and then have a number/text field pop up on the selected ingredients only in order to specify the quantity of the selected ingredient. That was too advanced so I had to use a simple text field.
- Personally I use the safari browser but the time selector used for the preparation times does not work properly on Safari.. It does work on Chrome though so all good.
- I had two main sections (Contact / Recipe details) and then within the Recipe Details there were also a few sections that were titles and not labels (Preparation Time / Baking). I used the label-tag on them because it was simple and looked fine. It would probably be better to style them with a header-tag but it seemed too much effort at that time to get it exactly in the same way so I did it the lazy way...
