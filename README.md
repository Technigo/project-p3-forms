# Project Name

Building a webpage with a (semi)working form

## The problem

For this challenge no JS was used to create the form (accessible via nav bar by clicking on "Sign In"). The focus was mainly on the styling of the form and its three main components. 

The main page lacks animation in the second row of cards (hovering effect). Working on it.

Features that overall would increase the appeal of the page and / or would be fun to try out:

- Language switch
- An improved and mobile-friendly footer
- The Log In form as a modal box instead of a whole new page.
- A Content Strucure
- Search Bar
- Another type of layout other than the responsive card layout
- Another type of menu other than the hamburger one
