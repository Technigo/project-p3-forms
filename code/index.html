      <h1>Hi, I am Widad!üëãüèº</h1>
      <h2>I am an IT consultant, beautician and a tea Lover.</h2>
      <p>SAY HI ON LINKEDIN</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Top 3 things that I'm great at:</h1>
    <h2>1. IT CONSULTANT</h2>
    <p>
      I have a long track record as an IT Consultant, mainly in functional
      testing and management. At the moment I am learning to program using
      HTML/CSS for web design and Python for the back end. During my experience,
      I had the chance to meet people all over the world on different projects
      at different places in the world (London, Z√ºrich, Edinburgh, ...).
    </p>

    <h2>2. BEAUTICIAN</h2>
    <p>
      While I was working in IT at IBM UK, I took evening beauty courses and I
      am qualified as a Hairdresser, Facial Care, Eye Care, Nail Care and
      Waxing! I love helping people and feeling good about itself is exactly the
      aim or an aspect of it! Helping people enhancing their true potential is
      exactly why after an 8 to 5 job, I enthusiastically made the effort to go
      to evening classes twice a week!
    </p>

    <h2>3. TRAVELLING</h2>
    <p>
      I had the chance to explore different part of the world while beeing on IT
      assignments! And still carry on when time and opportunity allows! There is
      still quite a lot to explore physically! But I am also travelling lands
      through my friends and their respectiv background!
